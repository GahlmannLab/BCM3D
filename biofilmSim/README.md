**cellModeller** - Transfer simulation result from CellModeller to a .mat file.

**PSF_generate** - Process PSFs of  our home-build lattice light sheet microscope to match the voxel size and axes' orientations of the simulated fluorescence images.

**simMixedLabels** - simulate fluorescence images of mixlabel biofilms (e.g. membrane label vs membrane&cytosol label) and generate corresponding ground truth.

**simMixedLabels** - simulate fluorescence images of mixshape biofilms (e.g. rod-shaped vs spherical cells ) and generate corresponding ground truth.

**simMultiDensityanSBRs** - simulate various SBR fluorescence images of single population biofilms with different cell density and generate corresponding ground truth.
