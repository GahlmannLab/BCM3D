#### Simulate 3D fluorescence mixshaped biofilms stacks and their corresponding GTs.**

###### Mixshaped biofilms means multi population biofilms that cells have different shapes (e.g. spherical vs. rod shaped cells). 

The master script is run_cellmodeler_convolution_mixshape.m .

*inputs:*

It reads CellModeller simulation results from 'cell_parameter_eachframe.mat' and gets psf from 'PSF488.mat', parameters can be changed accordingly.

Here,  CellModeller only simulates rod shape cells, spherical shape cells are generated by shortening randomly selected rod shape cells in long axis. 

*outputs:*
It saves .tif ground truth separately into Result/rod_gt and Result/sphere_gt

It saves raw simulated fluorescence stack .tif into Result/mixshape_raw

It saves deconvolved simulated fluorescence stack .tif into Result/mixshape_deconv
