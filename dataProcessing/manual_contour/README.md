1. Run manual_select_contour.m to manually trace cell outlines.
2. Run assign_contour2cells_v2.m to group 2D cell contours to single cells
This step will call the function to extract clusters from adjecent matrix. The code is referred from the following link.

3. Run Clustering_1st.m to segment cells from unsegmented clusters in step 2.
This step will call the function DBSCAN.m to group points. The code is referred from the following link.
