Run each corresponding .m file to plot the 'Cell counting accuracy' vs 'Jaccard index threshold' curve for each segmentation algorithm.Input:Ground truth .tif files and processed data saved as .tif (BiofilmQ results) .mat (results of other methods) files.Output:A figure shows the 'Cell counting accuracy' vs 'Jaccard index threshold' curve.A .mat file contains all variables during the calculation of cell counting accuracy. 'jaccradRange' and 'Jaccard_countingAccuracy_avg' are used to plot the curve.
