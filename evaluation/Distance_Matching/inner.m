function y = inner(a,b)
% This is a MatLab function to compute the inner product of
% two vectors a and b.
% By Ralph Howard on 1/12/98
% Call syntax: y = inner(a,b) or inner(a,b)
% Input: The two vectors a and b
% Output: The value of the inner product of a and b.
c=0;            % intialize the variable c
n= length(a);        % get the lenght of the vector a
for k=1:n        % start the loop
    c=c+a(k)*b(k);    % update c by the k-th product in inner product
end
y = c;
end
